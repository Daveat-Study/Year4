### <h3> 4.1. Project Time Management Processes </h3>

    * Techniques for shortening a Project Schedule.

        - Shorten duration of critical by adding more resources or changing their scope.
        + Crashing tasks by obtaining
            - advantage: can shorten the time it takes to finish a project.
            - Disadvantage: it often increases total project costs.
        + Fast tracking tasks
            - Advantage: like crashing.
            - It can end up lengthening the project schedule.

    d). Critical Chain Scheduling.
        - Critical chain scheduling is a method of scheduling that takes limited resources

    e). Program Evaluatioin and Reviw Technique (PERT)

        - is a network analysis technique used to estimate project duration where there is high degree of uncertainty about the individual activity duration estimates.
        - uses probabilistic times estimates based on using optimistic, most likely, pessimistic of activity durations.
        - 

PERT Formula
    គណនាproject មិនច្បាស់លាស់ឬមិនធ្លាប់ធ្វើពីមុនគណនាតាមរូបមន្តដូចខាងក្រោម:
    * PERT weighted average formula:
        - Te = To + 4Tm + Tp / 6

### <h3> 4.6. Controlling Changes to the Project Schedule </h3>
    
    - Perform reality checks on schedules.
    - Allow for contigencies
    - Don't plan for everyone to work at 100% capacity all the time.
    - Hold progress meetings with stakeholders and be clear and honest in communicating schedule issues.
    * Working with People issues:
    - String leadership helps projects succeed more than good PERT charts
    + Project managers should use
        - empower

    Process (3)
    4.5. Schedule Development
        - Schedule development uses results of the other time management process to determine the start and end.
        - Ultimate goal to create a realistic project schedule.
        + Important tools and techniques: 
            - Gantt charts, 
            - PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technqiue) analysis, 
            - critical path analysis, 
            - and critical chain scheduling.

        a) Creating Tasks (uses MS Project)
            - General tasks: are the usual tasks that are independent and have no special characteristics related to their duration or time.
                Ex: analysis: A, B
            - Milestone tasks: are the second type of task you can create using MS Project.
                Ex: Analysis Complete.
            - Recurring tasks: occur repeatedly at regular intervals.
                Ex: a weekly project meeting with all the team members is a recurring.

        b) Gantt Charts:
            - Charts created by Mr Henry Gantt and provide a standard format for displaying project schedule
            + Symbols include:
                - A black dialog: milestones or significant events on a project with zero duration
                - Thick black bars: summary tasks
                - Lighter horizontal bars: tasks

    4.3. Activity Sequencing
    (Continue)
    b) Task Dependency Types:
        => 4 kinds of task dependencies in MS project.

        1. Finish-to-start (FS): 
            -Task (B) cannot start until task (A) finishes. 

        2. Start-to-start (SS):
            -Task (B) cannot start until task (A) starts.
            - No care about finish first, care only who start first and last.

        3. Finish-to-finish (FF):
            - Task (B) cannot finish until task (A) finishes.
            - No care about start first, care only who finish first and last.
        4. Start-to-finish (SF):
            Task (B) cannot finish until task (A) starts.

        Example: 

            FS: - Installing the network cards before connecting PCs to the Internet. 
                - We cannot provider user training until after SW or a new System, has been installed.

            SS: - we cannot start MS Word or other applications until after Windows start.

            FF: - Quality control effort cannot finish before production finishes.

            SF: - The start of the new shift or the security guard signal the finish shift of the current security guard. if the next shift security guard didn't turn up (arrive), the first shift security guard has to continue his duty.

    Process (3)
    4.4. Activity Duration Estimating
        - After define activities, determining, sequence, the next step in time manangement is duration estimating.
        - Duration: the amt of time workded on activity plus elapsed time.
        + Effort: 
            - the number of workdays or work hours required to complete a task.
            - Not equal duration.

    4.3. Activity Sequencing

    * You must determine dependencies in order to use critical path analysis.

    a) Project Network Diagrams:
        - Project network diagrams.

        Crtical path: 
            - found perioud time to do project.
            - Path that have long day to do in project.

        Path:
            1: A-D-H-J  Length = 1 + 4 + 6 + 3 =    14  days
            2: B-E-H-J  Length = 2 + 5 + 6 + 3 =    16  days
            3: B-F-J    Length = 2 + 4 + 3 =        9   days
            4: C-G-I-J  Length = 3 + 6 + 2 + 3 =    14  days

            => Path 2 : B-E-H-J ជា Critical path ដែលមាន Length = 16 days
            => Project x ច្រើរយៈពេល១៦ថ្ងៃដើម្បីអនុវត្ត។

        * Process for Creating AOA(Activity on Arrow Diagram) Diagram
            1. Find all the activities that start at node 1.
                - Draw finish nodes
                - draw arrows between node 1 and those finihs nodes
                - put activities letter or name and duration estimate on the associated arrow.

            2. Continue drawing the network diagram:
                - work from left to right
                - Look for burst and merges
                * Burst occurs when single node followed by two or more activities.
                * A merge occurs
            
            3. Drawing the project network diagram until all activities are include on the diagram.

            4. As a rule of thumb(ជាទម្លាប់): All arrowheads should face toward and right and no arrow should cross on an AOA network diagram.

        * Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)

            - called activity-on-node (AON)
            - Activities are represented by boxes
            - Arrow show relationships between activities
            - More popular than ADM method and used by project management software 
            - Better at showing different types of dependencies
            - Can be done.

### <h3> 4.1. Project Time Management Processes </h3>

    - Involve the processes required to timely completion of a project
    * have 5 processes include:
        - Activity definiton
        - Activity sequencing: រៀបលំដាប់លំដោយ
        - Activity duration estimating
        - Schedule development
        - Schedule control

        Process (1)
        4.2. Activity Definition:
            - grow out of the basic document that initate a project.
            * Project charter includes start and end dates and budget info.
            - Scope statement and WBS help define what will be done.
            * Activity definition involves developing more detail WBS and supporting explanation.

        Process (2)
        4.3. Activity Sequencing
            - Involves reviewing activities and determining dependencies.
            
            * dependencies have 3:
                - Mandotory: inherent in the nature of work (hard logic) or force it to do first. ចាប់បង្ខំ
                - Discretionary: defined by the project team.(Soft logic) អាស្រ័យទៅលើថាតើ១ណាធ្វើមុន១ណាធ្វើក្រោយ
                - External: involve relatiionships btw project N non-project activities.
