    * You must determine dependencies in order to use critical path analysis.

    a) Project Network Diagrams:
        - Project network diagrams.

    Crtical path: 
        - found perioud time to do project.
        - Path that have long day to do in project.

    Path:
        1: A-D-H-J  Length = 1 + 4 + 6 + 3 =    14  days
        2: B-E-H-J  Length = 2 + 5 + 6 + 3 =    16  days
        3: B-F-J    Length = 2 + 4 + 3 =        9   days
        4: C-G-I-J  Length = 3 + 6 + 2 + 3 =    14  days

        => Path 2 : B-E-H-J ជា Critical path ដែលមាន Length = 16 days
        => Project x ច្រើរយៈពេល១៦ថ្ងៃដើម្បីអនុវត្ត។

    * Process for Creating AOA(Activity on Arrow Diagram) Diagram
        1. Find all the activities that start at node 1.
            - Draw finish nodes
            - draw arrows between node 1 and those finihs nodes
            - put activities letter or name and duration estimate on the associated arrow.

        2. Continue drawing the network diagram:
            - work from left to right
            - Look for burst and merges
            * Burst occurs when single node followed by two or more activities.
            * A merge occurs
        
        3. Drawing the project network diagram until all activities are include on the diagram.

        4. As a rule of thumb(ជាទម្លាប់): All arrowheads should face toward and right and no arrow should cross on an AOA network diagram.

    * Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)

        - called activity-on-node (AON)
        - Activities are represented by boxes
        - Arrow show relationships between activities
        - More popular than ADM method and used by project management software 
        - Better at showing different types of dependencies
        - Can be done.

### <h3> 4.1. Project Time Management Processes </h3>

    - Involve the processes required to timely completion of a project
    * have 5 processes include:
        - Activity definiton
        - Activity sequencing: រៀបលំដាប់លំដោយ
        - Activity duration estimating
        - Schedule development
        - Schedule control

        Process (1)
        4.2. Activity Definition:
            - grow out of the basic document that initate a project.
            * Project charter includes start and end dates and budget info.
            - Scope statement and WBS help define what will be done.
            * Activity definition involves developing more detail WBS and supporting explanation.

        Process (2)
        4.3. Activity Sequencing
            - Involves reviewing activities and determining dependencies.
            
            * dependencies have 3:
                - Mandotory: inherent in the nature of work (hard logic) or force it to do first. ចាប់បង្ខំ
                - Discretionary: defined by the project team.(Soft logic) អាស្រ័យទៅលើថាតើ១ណាធ្វើមុន១ណាធ្វើក្រោយ
                - External: involve relatiionships btw project N non-project activities.
