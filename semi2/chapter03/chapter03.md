* payback Period:

    * Even:
        * Formula:
          - To calculate

          ---------------------------------------------------------------
          | Payback Period = initial Investment / Cash inflow per period|
          ---------------------------------------------------------------

        Example: Invest 100$ in 4 Years period
            - Year1: 40
            - Year2: 30
            - Year3: 30

    * Uneven: សេស
        Example: Invest 100$ in 4 Years period
        - Year1: 40
        - Year2: 30
        - Year3: 45
        - Year4: 40

        * Calculate: B?C = | 70-100 | / 45 = 0.66
        * So payback period will be in: A + (B/C) = 2 + 0.66 = 2.66 Year Then you can calculate in month, week, day.
        * Convert 2.66 year to month = 2.66x12 = 32 
          months = 2 years and 8 months

* Return  on Investment:

    - ROI is calculated by (costs - benefit) / costs
    - | | ប្រើតម្លៃដាច់ខាតព្រោះwanna force value inside become to positive

    Formula with Discount:
        - ROI: (total discounted benefits - |total discount costs|) / |total discounted costs|
        
* Where:
    - Discounted benefits for each year = Discount factor * Benefit for each year.
    - Discounted costs for each year = Discount factor * Cost for each year.
    - Discount factor = 1/(1+r)t

    Another calculating of NPV

    |------------------------------------------------------------|
    | NPV = total discounted benefits - |total discounted costs| |
    |------------------------------------------------------------|

* NPV Calculations:
    - Determine estimated costs and benefits
    - Determine the discount rate
    - Calculate the NPV

2). Categorizing IT projects

    * One categorization is whether the project addresses:
        - Problems: undesirable situation
        - Opportunities: chances to improve the org.
        - Directive: new requirement imposed by management, goverment, some external influence.

3). Financial Analysis of Projects

(1). Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis

    * Formula:
              n
        NPV = Σ A * DF
              i=1 

              
        - r: Discount rate
        - A = amount
