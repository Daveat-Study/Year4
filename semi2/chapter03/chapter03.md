------------------------------------

#### 27/Feb/22, 9:15-10:45am

#### 3.3). <u> Scope Planning and the Scope Statement </u>

* A scope statement:

    - A project justification
    - A brief dscription
    - A summary of all project deliverables

#### 3.4). <u> Scope Definition and the Work Breakdown Structure </u>

    - After completing scope planning, the next step is to further define the work by breaking it into manageable pieces.

    * Good scope definition:
        - Help improve the accuracy of time, cost, resource estimate.
        - Defines a baseline for performance measurement and project control.
        - aids in communicating clear work responsibilities.
    
    a). The work Breakdown structure:
        - A work breakdown structure (WBS)
        - It is a foundation document in project management

    b). Sample Intranet WS Organized by Product.
        - 

    c).

    d). Intranet WBS in Tabular Form
        - Form that contain Table in book.

        1.0. Concept:
            1.1 Evaluate current systems.
            1.2 Define Requirements
                1.2.1 Define user requirements
                1.2.2 Define content requirements
                1.2.3 Define system requirements
                1.2.4 Define server owner requirements
            1.3 Define specific functionality
            1.4 Define risk and risk management approach|
            1.5 Develop project plan
        1.6 Brief Web development team
        2.0 Web Site Design
        3.0 Web Site Development 4.0 Roll Out
        5.0 Support

    e). Intranet WBS and Gantt Chart In MS Project.
        - long or short: refer to time.
        - Dependency.

    f). Intranet WBS and Gantt Chart Organized by Project Management Process Groups.

        2. 
        3.
        4.

    g). Approaches to Developing WBSs:
    * 4 Approaches:
        3. Using guideline: some orgs, like DoD (Department of Defence)
        4. The analogy approach:
        5. The top-down approach:

    h). Basic Principles for Creating WBSs:
        6. A unit of work should appear at only one place in the WBS.
        7. The work content of a WBS item is the sum of the WBS
        8. A WBS item is the responsibility of only one individual, even though many people may be working on it.
        9. The WBS must be consisten with the way in which work is actually going to be performed; it should server the project eam first and other purposes only if practical.
        10. 
        6.

#### 3.5). <u> Scope Verification and Scope Change COntrol </u>

    - It is very difficult to create a good scope statement and WBS for a project.

    * Using Software to Assis in Project Scope Management


Question:
1) What is project scope manangment?
2) Project initiation:

#### c). <u> Project Charter </u>

* The key parts of the project charter are:
    1. The project's title and date of authorization.
    2. The project manager's name and contact info.
    3. A brief scope statement for the project.
    4. A summary of the planned approach for mananging the project.
    5. A roles and responsibilities matrix.
    6. A sign-off section for signature of key project stakeholders.
    7. A comment section in which stakeholder

* payback Period:

    * Even:
        * Formula:
          - To calculate

          ----------------------------------------------------------------
          | Payback Period = initial Investment / Cash inflow per period |
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

        Example: Invest 100$ in 4 Years period
            - Year1: 40
            - Year2: 30
            - Year3: 30

    * Uneven: សេស
        Example: Invest 100$ in 4 Years period
        - Year1: 40
        - Year2: 30
        - Year3: 45
        - Year4: 40

        * Calculate: B?C = | 70-100 | / 45 = 0.66
        * So payback period will be in: A + (B/C) = 2 + 0.66 = 2.66 Year Then you can calculate in month, week, day.
        * Convert 2.66 year to month = 2.66x12 = 32 
          months = 2 years and 8 months

* Return  on Investment:

    - ROI is calculated by (costs - benefit) / costs
    - | | ប្រើតម្លៃដាច់ខាតព្រោះwanna force value inside become to positive

    Formula with Discount:
        - ROI: (total discounted benefits - |total discount costs|) / |total discounted costs|
        
* Where:
    - Discounted benefits for each year = Discount factor * Benefit for each year.
    - Discounted costs for each year = Discount factor * Cost for each year.
    - Discount factor = 1/(1+r)t

    Another calculating of NPV

    |------------------------------------------------------------|
    | NPV = total discounted benefits - |total discounted costs| |
    |------------------------------------------------------------|

* NPV Calculations:
    - Determine estimated costs and benefits
    - Determine the discount rate
    - Calculate the NPV

    Formula:

2). Categorizing IT projects

    * One categorization is whether the project addresses:
        - Problems: undesirable situation
        - Opportunities: chances to improve the org.
        - Directive: new requirement imposed by management, goverment, some external influence.

3). Financial Analysis of Projects

(1). Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis

    * Formula:
              n
        NPV = Σ A * DF
              i=1 

              
        - r: Discount rate
        - A = amount

------------------------------------

* Project Scope management: 

    - is refer to all work involved in creating the products.
    * include the processes involve define and controlling.
        1. Initiation
        2. Scope planning
        3. Scope definition:
        4. Scope verifictiona
        5. Scope change control
