1.2 Concept:

	+ What is Software?
		+ Software is a set of instructions, written by one or more programming language to perform automatically some functions in solving any problem. 
			- Instuctions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired function and performance.
			- Data structure that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information.
			- Documents that describe the operation and use of the programs.

1.1 The history of S.E

	+ Some of reasons that make software crisis in first software development in 19th century:
		1. Software developers used multiple programming language.
		2. Software developers used multiple variabtions of standard programming language
		3. Most of the requirement were complex with regard to the existing capabilitires.
		4. Users, who had little of no experience of devloping or even using software, formulated requirement.
		5. Software developers poorly mapped requirements to the actual product.
		5. Software developed had low interoperability.
		6. Software maintenance was costly.
		7. Hardware deeloped at a faster rate than software(better hardware requires better software to operate it)
		
	+ In 19th centery some country that define SW (SW Crisis) is 70% in plan that relate Information Technology.

	+ NATO made conference about science in Munich (1968) city to solve those of crisis.  

	+ After crisis: software problem they start birth Software Engineering to solve (SE).

	+ Why SE? - because to solve and prevent problem that can occure in software in the future.
		- Build it correct the first time.
		- Reduce development cost.
		- Reduce development time.
		- Repeat previous successes.
		- Learn from previous failures.

	+ Goal of SE:
		1. To improve the quality of the software products.
		2. To increase the productivity (ផលិតភាព: ភាពដែលអាចផលិតបាន).
		3. To give job satisfaction the the software engineers.
