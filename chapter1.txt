Chapter 1: OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

    1). Clss & Object:
        - class is source code that we can define data(field), property, method, event inside it follow object that we want.

            Ex: class ClassName {
                -----------
            }

        - Object is things that create from Class:

            Ex: ClassType Object = new classType();

    2). Class members:

        i). Field:
            + Components of class:

                - Data (Field):
                - Properties:
                - Method:
                - Event: 

            + Variable have two:
                - Scalar variable is a variable or memory location that can store only one variable.
                - Array is a variable or memory location that can store multiple value.

            + Value Type & Referene Type:
                - Value Type: store value directly inside it own location memory.
                - Referene Type: store only address that refer to value. Doesn't store its value directly.

                    Ex: y|address| -----> | ABCD |

        ii). property: is a block code that we can write code to access( Read/Write ) to private data.

            Ex: public returnType PropertyName {

                get { return Varname; }
                set { Varname value; }
            }

            Code:

                class Student {

                    // Field
                    private int x;

                    // Property
                    public int Px{
                        get { return x; }
                        set { x = value; }
                    }
                }

                Student obj = new Student();
                obj.px = 10;
                int i = obj.px;

Chapter 1: OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

    - To have object with need to create class.

    - Class is source code.

    - ដើម្បីបង្កើតObjectត្រូវដឹងពីរបស់សម្គាល់ (field or properties, member variable)

    + In Programming:
        - Data
        - Function

    + In OOP:
        - Data 
        - Properties 
        - Method 
        - Event

    Field ជា member variable របស់ class
    - មុខងារសំរាប់ store data
