##### <u> c). Project Metrics </u>

- Projet metrics are specific to the actal execuation of a project.
- avoid project delays.
- They measure the effectiveness of factors for a project.
- They are implemented in every pahase of the SDLC.
- Comprise effort (measure in **FP**):
    - productivity.
    - cost
    - size
    - defects
    - and testng

+ Effort Metrics:
    - enable u to determine the amount of effort to complete a project.
    - calculated in person-months (man-months.)
    - planned value for effort is known as the baseline value.

    Planned Value <=> BaseLine Value

* ជាទូទៅ:
    - If measurement metrics on phase SDLC:
    1. AV (Actual Value) > PV (Planned Value) ឬ BV (Baseline Value) 
        => អត់ល្អ.
        => Re-Check up on management
        => កែលម្អ.

    2. AV <= PV => ល្អ

##### <u> b). Process Metrics </u>

- Look to Triangle process.

    + People: មានឥទ្ធិពលយ៉ាងខ្លាំងទៅលើprocess
        - Development Environment: CASE Tool (Computer-Aided SE).

    + Product: មានឥទ្ធិពលទៅលើ quality and team performance. ហើយសំដៅទៅលើឧបការណ៍ប្រើប្រាស់
        - Business Condition: deadline, business rules.

    + Technology ( ដូចជា SE method ): មានឥទ្ធិពលទៅលើដែរ
        - Customer characteristics: ease of communication

##### <u> a). What is Metric ?</u>

- __Measure:__ is a quantitative indication of the extent, amount, dimension, capacity, or size of some attributes of a product or process.

- __Measurement:__ is the act of determining a measure.

- <b>Metric:</b> is quantitative measure of the degree to which a program, component, or process possosses a given attribute.
    - <b>IEEE:</b> 
    - <b>Glossary (the same Dictionary):<b> សទ្ទានុក្រម 

- __Indicator (សូចនាករ):__ ជាខ្នាត១ដែលគេកំណត់សម្រាប់យកមកវាស់.

- Metrics :__ assign values to quantitative factors.

- Metrics facilitate project planing

- A metic enable you to measure the quality of a factor(កត្តា).

- You can measure and quantity a factor only if the factor has numberic values.

* What do we measure?
    >- Process 
    >- Project
    >- Product
    >- Design
    >- Maintenance?

* Why do we measure?
    >- To characterize.
    >- To evaludate.
    >- To predict.
    >- To improve.
