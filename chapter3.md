#### <u> 3.2 Types of Software Metrics </u>

- Size metric is calculated for an entire project.
- The size of a project may vary with respect to the changes.
- Affects effort directly.

#### <u> d). Product Metrics</u>

- is measure the quality and conformance to requirement of the deliverables.
- Two factors are meausered:
    - Effectiveness

* Forumla:
    Effectiveness = (Quantity in % * Quality in %) / 100

    Exam

##### <u> 6. Testing Metrics</u>

- use to measure the number of test cases that required to test SW.
- Test case is to executed to test a particular module in SW.
- There are separate test cases:
    - Integration testing refers to the overall black box.
    - In contrast, unit testing refers to individual modules of SW.

| Metric(s) | Coding |
|-----------| ------|
|Testing| dsf |

##### <u> 5. Defects metric: ( Error occure before to user )</u>

- The number of defects defines the quality of project.
- If defects large. the quality is inferior. In contrast the quality is superior.
- Defects can occure during SDLC. 
    1. Severe(កំហុសកំរិតធ្ងន់) defect: critically affect the functionality of a product.
    2. Major defects(កំហុសកំរិតមធ្យម): logically affect the functionality of a product.
    3. A minor defect(កំហុសកំរិតស្រាល): slide defect that mact as an irritant for uses but does not disturb the functionality of a product.

##### <u> 4. Size metric: </u>

##### <u> 3. Cost metric: </u>
- Expense inccured on a project.
- Spend on resource.
  
##### <u> c). Project Metrics </u>

- The effort in performing an FP of work in an hour is called productivity.
- To calculate productivity: determine the total of FP
- To caculate accurate productivity: need two types of data:
    - Actual effort in person hours
    - Actual size of the project in FP.

#### <u> 3.2 Types of Software Metrics </u>
##### <u> c). Project Metrics </u>

- Projet metrics are specific to the actal execuation of a project.
- avoid project delays.
- They measure the effectiveness of factors for a project.
- They are implemented in every pahase of the SDLC.
- Comprise effort (measure in **FP**):
    - productivity.
    - cost
    - size
    - defects
    - and testng

+ Effort Metrics:
    - enable u to determine the amount of effort to complete a project.
    - calculated in person-months (man-months.)
    - planned value for effort is known as the baseline value.

    Planned Value <=> BaseLine Value

* ជាទូទៅ:
    - If measurement metrics on phase SDLC:
    1. AV (Actual Value) > PV (Planned Value) ឬ BV (Baseline Value) 
        => អត់ល្អ.
        => Re-Check up on management
        => កែលម្អ.

    2. AV <= PV => ល្អ

#### <u> 3.2 Types of Software Metrics </u>
##### <u> b). Process Metrics </u>

- Look to Triangle process.

    + People: មានឥទ្ធិពលយ៉ាងខ្លាំងទៅលើprocess
        - Development Environment: CASE Tool (Computer-Aided SE).

    + Product: មានឥទ្ធិពលទៅលើ quality and team performance. ហើយសំដៅទៅលើឧបការណ៍ប្រើប្រាស់
        - Business Condition: deadline, business rules.

    + Technology ( ដូចជា SE method ): មានឥទ្ធិពលទៅលើដែរ
        - Customer characteristics: ease of communication

#### <u> 3.1 SW Metrics </u>

##### <u> a). What is Metric ?</u>

- __Measure:__ is a quantitative indication of the extent, amount, dimension, capacity, or size of some attributes of a product or process.

- __Measurement:__ is the act of determining a measure.

- <b>Metric:</b> is quantitative measure of the degree to which a program, component, or process possosses a given attribute.
    - <b>IEEE:</b> 
    - <b>Glossary (the same Dictionary):<b> សទ្ទានុក្រម 

- __Indicator (សូចនាករ):__ ជាខ្នាត១ដែលគេកំណត់សម្រាប់យកមកវាស់.

- Metrics :__ assign values to quantitative factors.

- Metrics facilitate project planing

- A metic enable you to measure the quality of a factor(កត្តា).

- You can measure and quantity a factor only if the factor has numberic values.

* What do we measure?
    >- Process 
    >- Project
    >- Product
    >- Design
    >- Maintenance?

* Why do we measure?
    >- To characterize.
    >- To evaludate.
    >- To predict.
    >- To improve.
