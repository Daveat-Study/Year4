##### <u> FP Technique </u>

- is direct indicator of the functionality
- The most popular used to estimate the size of SE Project.
- You use to estimate the size of a project.
- The total size is estimated as a single FP value.

##### <u> Disadvantages of Using SLOC </u>

1. LOC depends on experience of programmers.
2. 
3. To count LOC even if we done of coding.

#### <u> 4.1. SLOC Techinque </u>

Examle:
    - គេប្រាប់ចំនួណ LOC សរុបនៃ system មួយ.
    - គេប្រាប់ផលិតភាពជាមធ្យមនៃ System មួយ
    - គេប្រាប់អត្រាថ្លៃឈ្នួលពលកម្ម
    - ចំនួនមនុស្សជាក់ស្តែងចូលរួមបង្កើត system.

    + Fomular:
    => Cost per LOC = Labor rate / Productivity
    => Total Cost of Project = Cost per LOC * Total number of LOCs
    => Estmated Effort = Total Cost of Project / Labor rate
    => Duration = Effort / People

#### <u> 4.1. SLOC Techinque </u>

- The SLOC technique is an objective method of estimating the size of the project.
- The project size helps determine the resource, effort, cost, and duration of the project.
- Directly calculate the effort to be spend.
- use it when programming langauge and the technology to be predefined.
- This technique includes the calculation of lines of codes, docs of pages, inputs, 
outputs, and component of SW prgram.

##### Counting SLOC:
- The us

    There are many technique that can use to accurately estimate effort, such as:

- Source Lines of Code **(SLOC)**
- Function Point **(FP)**
- Constructive Cost Model **(COCOMO)**
- Delphi
