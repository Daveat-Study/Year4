#### <u> 4.1. SLOC Techinque </u>

- The SLOC technique is an objective method of estimating the size of the project.
- The project size helps determine the resource, effort, cost, and duration of the project.
- Directly calculate the effort to be spend.
- use it when programming langauge and the technology to be predefined.
- This technique includes the calculation of lines of codes, docs of pages, inputs, 
outputs, and component of SW prgram.

##### Counting SLOC:
- The us

    There are many technique that can use to accurately estimate effort, such as:

- Source Lines of Code **(SLOC)**
- Function Point **(FP)**
- Constructive Cost Model **(COCOMO)**
- Delphi
